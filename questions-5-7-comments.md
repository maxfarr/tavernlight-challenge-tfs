# Q5 - Ice Tornado spell

I recreated this example by modifying the Eternal Winter spell to loop through an array of random-looking combat areas and repeatedly casting ice tornadoes on them.
I couldn't get the look exactly right - in the original video, it looks like the spell is somehow shifted by half a grid tile, and I couldn't get the same distribution of large vs. small tornadoes. Additionally, my client doesn't show "Zelek says: frigo" for some reason... huh!
